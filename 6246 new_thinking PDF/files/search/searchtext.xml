to a fee-based model. at aviva, we saw the opportunity to help advisers with this potentially sensitive discussion with some new thinking. so we commissioned two of the uk’s leading experts in behavioural science – professor paul dolan of the london school of economics and best-selling business author steve martin. they provided innovative, practical support for advisers, including our frst new thinking book on client fees. the book was so benefcial to advisers that thousands used it. since then new thinking has helped advisers improve their digital skills, showing them how to  best use tools and technology to help them grow their business and connect  with clients. we’ve also summarised the most effective tips and brilliant business ideas from a range of business books to help you work more effectively – our  adviser bookshelf. now we’re turning our attention to another signifcant issue, which also  presents a signifcant opportunity – the sandwich generation. the sandwich generation, typically aged between 45 and 60 years old, face  a number of issues which cause fnancial, emotional and time pressures. they  are often caring for themselves and the generations above and below them. with 60% of consumers aged 45 to 60 belonging to the sandwich generation, they’re a vital audience. however, they’re often uncertain about what to do,  or even in some cases, what their needs are. that’s why we’ve commissioned more behavioural science new thinking, providing you with expert videos, downloads and this helpful book. and we’re delighted to be working with professor paul dolan and steve martin again, who are supporting advisers to use behavioural science to have more effective conversations with clients, and continue to act in their best interests.</Page><Page Number="4">5 about the authors paul dolan is a professor of behavioural science  in the department of social policy at the london  school of economics there are two main themes to professor dolan’s work. the frst focuses  on developing measures of well-being that can be used in policy, particularly in the valuation of non-market goods, such as clean air and water. the second considers ways in which the lessons from the behavioural sciences can be used to understand and impact individual behaviour. this work is focusing on the important role that situational factors play in infuencing our behaviour, as summarised in the ‘mindspace’ report for the cabinet offce. this report provided the intellectual momentum for the behavioural insights team in the cabinet offce, where paul was recently seconded at the invitation of the head of the uk civil service (the cabinet secretary). paul’s new book ‘happiness by design’ was published in august 2014. steve martin is a best-selling author,  business columnist and speaker together with dr robert cialdini and dr noah goldstein, he co-authored the new york times, wall street journal and business week international bestseller, ‘yes! 50 secrets from the science of persuasion’. steve regularly features in both the national and business press, including his monthly ‘persuasion’ column in the british airways in-fight magazine and his column in the harvard business review. combined, these are read by over 2 million readers each month. he has also led several adviser workshops for aviva, applying behavioural science to the needs of individual businesses. in his 2014 book, the smallbig, steve and his co-authors present over 50 small changes that can bring about momentous shifts in results. anyone can signifcantly increase their ability to infuence, not by informing or educating people, but by making small shifts in approach that link to deeply felt human motivations.</Page><Page Number="5">6 helping you earn cpd hours we

generation? you may have heard about the sandwich generation, and it’s more than  likely that you will have clients in this group already. in fact, this generation could make up as much as two thirds of your client base. mainly aged uk adults currently provide care to more than one generation 1/4 of the uk’s adult population have experienced caring for generations above and below them at some point in their lives over half state that they have responsibility for and support adult children</Page><Page Number="7">8 why are the sandwich generation ‘squeezed’? this generation face many issues and pressures. these include the conficting priorities that can come from caring for themselves and the generations above and below them. the sandwich generation have a lot of potential responsibilities: •	managing their personal fnancial issues – such as retirement planning, savings, investments, level of protection and private medical insurance •	supporting their children – for example, funding education or helping  them onto the property ladder •	caring for parents – such as long-term care planning or helping them  stay independent in their own home so what do they want from advisers? •	specialist advice focused on their specifc complex needs •	a better understanding of the product options available to them •	solutions that meet their unique circumstances time  poor experience inertia when making decisions and taking action pressurised</Page><Page Number="8">9 as one of the largest and most signifcant client segments, the sandwich generation are often in a fnancially stable position and have numerous  product needs. with so many overriding pressures, the sandwich generation (who can  be considered as dual carers of both their parents and children) often  don’t know where to start in terms of fnancial products. •	only 15% of dual carers have a private medical insurance policy •	only 11% of dual carers have critical illness cover •	only 6% of dual carers have income protection so what are the key areas you can discuss  with the sandwich generation? •	critical illness cover •	income protection •	inheritance tax planning •	life insurance •	long-term care planning •	mortgage products •	pensions and investments •	private medical insurance •	retirement planning •	school and university fees planning •	tax optimisation where clients are

science. the model can be used as  a helpful checklist when thinking about framing conversations. driver messenger we are heavily influenced by who communicates information to us example: when physiotherapists displayed their medical diplomas on their office walls, highlighting  their expertise, the percentage of people following  their recommended exercise programmes rose to 34%. 2 incentives our responses to incentives are shaped by predictable mental shortcuts such as strongly avoiding losses and preferring smaller payouts now rather than larger ones later example: householders were more likely to make energy efficiencies in their homes when told how 	 much money they would lose in future years rather 	 than how much they would save. 3 norms we are strongly influenced by what others do example: people are more likely to choose a busy restaurant over a less busy one, and pay their taxes on time when informed that others pay their taxes on time, primarily because people want to associate with others and be part of the social majority. 4 defaults we ‘go with the flow’ of pre-set options example: introducing automatic enrolment into a pension scheme significantly increases participation.</Page><Page Number="13">14 5 salience our attention is drawn to what is novel,  easy to process and seems relevant to us example: in a complex environment people crave simplicity and easy to process information. for example, studies show that the minimum payment amount on credit card statements attracts our attention. this influences our monthly repayment, as the amount has already been calculated for us and doesn’t require further processing. 6 priming our acts are often influenced by  subconscious cues example: people vote more conservatively if a polling station is located in a church rather than a school. people also think more creatively in rooms with high ceilings, and focus on specifics more in rooms with low ceilings. 7 affect our emotional associations can powerfully  shape our actions example: emotional experience can have an impact on decision-making. people are more likely to pay attention to the emotion-laden offer. for example, in one study people feeling sad would be unaware of their tendency to pay up to 30% more for an everyday consumer goods item, than consumers in a neutral or good mood. 8 commitments we seek to be consistent with our public promises, and reciprocate acts example: people who were asked to write down the details  of their next appointment on a reminder card were 18%  more likely to attend, compared to when the medical staff wrote it down for them. this is because they made the commitment themselves. 9 ego we act in ways that make us feel better  about ourselves example: when people were told that they were above-average citizens if they voted, they were 15% more likely  to vote, than if they were told they were average citizens  – people want to feel good about themselves.</Page><Page Number="14">15 the power of the smallbig the latest research from social psychology and behavioural economics explains why traditional infuencing strategies often carry a high rate of failure. we now live in the most information-overloaded environment that has  ever existed. people simply don’t have the time or mental energy to fully consider every piece of information in their busy lives. instead, decisions are increasingly governed by the context and psychological environment in which information is presented. people who understand  this can signifcantly increase the chances that others will listen to and act  on their recommendations. they can do this by making small changes in their approach that link  to three fundamental human motivations: behavioural scientists cialdini, goldstein and martin label a small change that makes a big difference as a smallbig. 1. making accurate decisions as effciently as possible 2. associating with and gaining the  	 approval of others 3. seeing yourself in a positive light</Page><Page Number="15">16 finding out more if you’d like to fnd out more about behavioural science, there is a range of videos, guides and other resources available at: avivasandwichgeneration.co.uk 16 behavioural science in action behavioural science techniques work best in combination. therefore, think about how you can join up the different approaches. for example, you could use messenger by considering how you are introduced prior to a new client meeting. this could be achieved by sending your biography in advance. also, messenger can be effective when looking for genuine similarities that you share with your client in the early stages of your meeting. the ego effect can be used by looking for genuine facts that you have found out about your client and explaining why they have made good decisions in the past. especially if those past decisions concern desirable behaviours that you would want that client to live up to in the future. you could also use smallbigs to appeal to the three fundamental  human motivations listed opposite.</Page><Page Number="16">17 visit avivasandwichgeneration.co.uk to answer  these

james, 52, for 15 years  and knew all about him and his family: his wife samantha and their two teenage sons. pete considered his relationship with the spencers to be quite a good one. the spencers would quite often seek his advice, and they would meet at least annually to discuss their fnancial situation. the spencers had remortgaged their house twice, but the end of their mortgage was now in sight. pete had also set up stocks and shares isas for james and samantha, giving them a wider range of assets in their savings portfolio, in addition to their own cash isas. both james and samantha have consistently paid into their work pensions throughout their careers (as a civil engineer and hr manager respectively).  they recently increased their contributions to further beneft from the tax relief. in addition, they set up a private pension 12 years ago on pete’s recommendation, which is regularly reviewed. on this occasion, james had booked a meeting with pete because he wanted  to review his current pension plans. however, during the course of the  meeting, pete recognised other gaps and risks in james’ situation that  were more imminent. james’ 82-year-old mother was becoming increasingly dependent upon the family, particularly after james’ father passed away unexpectedly two years ago. james and samantha were spending many evenings and weekends looking after her, giving them additional responsibility in their already busy lives. his mother, a property owner but with limited savings herself, had made no provision for inheritance tax. in addition to this, his two sons would soon be going to university, and james wanted to support them however he could. there were expensive times ahead that james hadn’t fully considered yet. once pete discovered this, it became clear that he should challenge his client’s current thinking about his fnancial situation and spur him to reconsider 	 his priorities. how insights from behavioural science can help advisers challenge a client’s current fnancial plans and spur them  to reconsider their priorities  case study 1 challenging your clients’ plans 52 52</Page><Page Number="19">20 the behavioural scientist’s view to an outsider it might be easy to conclude that pete’s client is displaying inertia to do anything about his changing situation. he may be fully aware that he should be doing something, but these changes have caused uncertainty about what steps he should take. knowing there is a need to do something doesn’t always lead to taking action. it could simply be the case that james is instead focusing on things that he is more certain about – pensions and savings – as a way of at least doing something positive. challenging people to rethink the decisions and commitments they  have previously made can be diffcult, because most people like to believe that they make well-informed, sensible decisions. often they have, given their circumstances at the time. but as we all know, circumstances do change, and sometimes it is simply easier to stay loyal and consistent to those previous decisions than it is to question them – to re-examine your situation and set off on a different, and less familiar, road. despite this there is an approach that pete can take – a small change that can make a big difference to his client’s receptiveness to his proposal. this can be done while being clear that he is not challenging his client’s previous decisions at all. the smallbig approach would be for pete to point out that the real culprit lying at the heart of james’ situation is circumstance. however, there is something else pete should consider doing before raising the issue of his client’s changing circumstances, and that is for pete to make the most of the ego effect. he should do this by clearly pointing out that the previous fnancial choices his client made were, and continue to be, sensible decisions. it doesn’t always follow that knowing about the need to do something, leads to taking action</Page><Page Number="20">21 it’s also important to highlight that james made those decisions while considering what is best for his family. this last step is especially important if pete is to challenge his client to consider actions more appropriate to his current circumstances, as there is one fundamental thing that hasn’t changed – james’ desire to do the right thing for his family. using the ego effect by labelling certain client behaviours as desirable can be very useful in the early stages of an interaction, because people typically want to live up to and be consistent with those desirable labels. using ego, and specifcally self-consistency in the initial stages of the interaction, can provide a good lead-in to the central and potentially more diffcult topic – how james’ changing circumstances require him to take a fresh approach. one thing that behavioural science tells us is that when people are uncertain about the right course of action, they will often look to the decisions of others like them as a cue for how to act themselves. this is called norms and is the n in the mindspace model. pete could use norms in two ways. first he can use a social norm to signal to his client that his situation is very similar to others like him. saying something like, “james, there are many other fathers like you, with teenage children approaching university age who are also dealing with the added pressures of ageing parents.” this seems like a small action for pete to take, but it could make a big difference to the way his client decides what to do about his situation – providing that pete then follows this statement with an equally important message which requires the use of another norm. that norm would be to point out the actions that fathers in similar circumstances have taken because of their changing situation, such as the different fnancial arrangements they  have made. behavioural science tells us that when people are uncertain, they look to the decisions of others like them as a cue for how to act themselves.</Page><Page Number="21">22 this dual-step approach, frst using the ego effect of the mindspace model followed by the action-orientated qualities of norms, could be an effective way to set the right context for a necessary, productive conversation that challenges his client’s current fnancial plans and encourages him to reconsider his priorities. cpd question case study 1 why might clients display inertia? (select one) a.	due to complacency b.	due to changing circumstances in uncertain situations c.	due to people in comparable fnancial situations taking different actions in summary: •	use the ego effect to label previous desirable behaviours as positive •	avoid directly challenging a client’s previous decisions and instead challenge changing circumstances •	use two norm statements, frst to highlight the number of people who face similar circumstances, and second to specifcally highlight the subsequent actions some have taken to effectively deal with  that situation visit avivasandwichgeneration.co.uk to answer  this evaluation question and earn your cpd hours 22</Page><Page Number="22">23 kirsty peters had been advising her client sally townsend, 48, for many years. almost a decade ago, sally left her job as a print manager and set up her own printing business. like many start-ups, sally had worked all hours to keep it solvent during its early days. after a few years, her business was stable and sally was able to take  a consistent wage, as well as invest in  a pension and savings account. however, sally was now experiencing pressure in her personal life, both fnancially and emotionally. she had divorced her husband, jack, three  years ago and had been forced to sell the family property and downsize. this meant she had an outstanding mortgage on her current property. following the sudden death of her mother two years ago, her elderly father had moved in with her. her 24-year-old son david also lived at home and had been out of work since completing his master’s degree in geography. sally was concerned about his future and what support she might need to give him, so he could fnd a job and become independent. sally was happy to be guided by kirsty’s fnancial recommendations.  one of the frst things kirsty had done was to set up a self-invested personal pension, which was reviewed regularly, to help sally prepare  for retirement. sally had also recently invested in private medical insurance  after kirsty had explained the benefts to her and arranged a level of  cover that suited her needs. kirsty had conducted annual reviews for sally, but still felt she wasn’t really aware of the underlying motivations driving her client’s fnancial needs. kirsty knew that if she could unlock her client’s core motivations she could help her achieve her fnancial and lifestyle goals.  how advisers can unlock their clients’ underlying motivations and open up potentially new approaches to help them achieve their fnancial goals case study 2 unlocking motivations 48</Page><Page Number="23">24 identifying a client’s core motivations will be an important activity for one crucial reason. while a client’s preferences and needs will often change over time – perhaps due to changing circumstances – their fundamental values and motivations are unlikely to change. as a result, aligning your recommendations to a fundamental motivation or value can be helpful  in directing attention. however, identifying and successfully tapping into a client’s core motivations requires the adviser to make a change in how they ask questions. when attempting to understand what’s best for their client, they should think beyond the usual needs-based questions. fortunately, this change in approach requires only a small change in  the words used that can make a big difference in the type of information generated. it’s a good example of a smallbig – a small change that can make a big difference. imagine for a few moments that as a result of an unexpected pay 		 rise you fnd yourself with an extra 200 a month in disposable income.  what would you do with it? save a little more? put it towards a 	 	 nice holiday? now consider this alternative question – if you had an extra 200 a month disposable income what would it mean to you? more security? more freedom? would you be happier? less stressed? notice how the frst question (what would you do with it?) typically  elicits tangible responses such as a house or a nicer car. the second question however (what would it mean to you?), generally elicits responses that are more value or motivation based – for example greater security, more freedom, feeling happier or less stressed. these are the motivations that are being served by the choices the client is making. the behavioural scientist’s view while a client’s preferences and needs will often change over time, a client’s fundamental values and motivations are unlikely to.</Page><Page Number="24">25 one way that kirsty can unlock her client sally’s motivations is to not only ask the more tangible questions such as when does she want to retire, or will she be helping her son with a frst mortgage deposit, or even about plans for her father’s care in the long term, but also to ask her what accomplishing those will mean to her. if, as a result of asking that question, sally tells her adviser that knowing she can retire by a certain date gives her a feeling of control and that the ability to help her son with a deposit will provide her with a deeper sense of achievement, then kirsty will have unlocked two of her client’s underlying motivations. if kirsty then frames the advice she gives as a way of achieving control or gaining that sense of achievement, then it should be especially attractive to her client. this is because, as we have already stated, people rarely deviate from their fundamental motivations and values. there are additional reasons why an adviser would want to ask questions that unlock clients’ core motivations. advice aligned to these motivations stands an improved chance of being considered and acted on. this deeper understanding of a client’s motivations can lead to the development of stronger and longer relationships, increased trust and repeat business.  the unlocking of these types of motivation is extremely helpful, but it won’t be enough alone. it will also be necessary to discuss specifc options and products that are linked to these core motivations. the s in mindspace stands for salience – the fact that our attention  will often be drawn to how easy something is to think about or how available it is to us. it is this availability that is key here. the ease with which information is made available to us and the ease with which we can think about that information can often have a dramatic infuence  on our perceptions, assumptions and decisions. identifying a client’s core motivations will be important for the adviser – this requires one small change to a commonly asked question.</Page><Page Number="25">26 for example, in one study people who were asked to imagine what it would be like to own a new satellite tv system were much more likely to purchase that product in the future than another group who weren’t asked to imagine owning it. why? the simple explanation is because their attention was directed to what owning it would be like and therefore the information was now more available to them. of course, the easier it is to imagine the specifc benefts of owning such a product or service, the more likely it will be that people subsequently take action. so one small thing an adviser can do when presenting products and services, is to ask clients to imagine the benefts of owning such an item. this will give them a better understanding of if it is right for them. in the case of kirsty, she can see what her client sally has achieved professionally and personally. but, the underlying motivations that drive her client’s decisions and behaviours are less apparent. by changing the way she frames her questions, kirsty may be able to unlock her client’s underlying motivations and help her achieve her fnancial goals. kirsty can then use the salience effect to help sally consider which solutions might work best for her. it can be a good idea to ask clients to imagine the benefts of a specifc product, to see if it’s right for them. the availability  of information and the ease in which we can think about something  can often have a dramatic infuence on our perceptions</Page><Page Number="26">27 cpd question case study 2 what is an example of a question an adviser can ask a client to unlock their motivations and values?

case study 3 visualising the future george baxter is 57 and married with a 26-year-old daughter. he is the main family earner and the owner of a catering frm in yorkshire. he earns 75,000 a year – but with a hefty mortgage and signifcant monthly pension contributions he doesn’t have as much disposable income as he would like. his wife, joy, 53, is a school librarian, and her income is mainly used to fund their regular holidays abroad. george’s father, keith, is stubbornly independent, and wants to live in the house that he shared with his wife for 50 years, despite his health starting to decline. keith refuses to talk about his future health, estate planning or his fnancial circumstances, a trait that george recognises in himself. greg andrews has advised george for seven years, and has helped put  in place a self-invested personal pension, several stocks and shares isas, and even supported him through the auto-enrolment of the employees  in his frm. but when greg broaches the subject of wider fnancial planning with george to help him better prepare for the future – when he might retire, supporting his daughter with her own business start-up ambitions and helping him plan for his father’s likely care – he doesn’t want to talk  about it. from the conversations greg has had with george, it is clear that he struggles to plan for the short term, never mind what might happen in years to come. george often arrives late to his meetings or cuts them  short, and greg often feels he doesn’t have his client’s full attention. greg is aware that the current challenges on his ‘squeezed’ client’s income, as well as his reluctance to think about diffcult situations and his busy lifestyle, are stopping him from making decisions. at the moment,  george is not prepared to think in the long term – and this could leave  him vulnerable to unforeseen circumstances. how advisers can help their clients consider and visualise future life events – even potentially uncomfortable and unforeseen ones 57</Page><Page Number="28">29 george’s reactions to greg’s attempts to get him to consider some alternative yet important aspects of his fnancial situation are understandable. they are almost certainly an emotional reaction to feeling overwhelmed and uncertain, rather than a result of greg’s approach. there is an important lesson to be learnt here. sometimes even the right message, regardless of how well intended it is, may not be taken in a positive way, especially if the client is feeling under a lot of pressure and is very busy. in the mindspace model the a stands for affect – the psychological term for feelings and emotions. it’s the idea that our emotional reactions to a stimulus can activate behaviours before we even notice them happening. we’ve all had the experience of reacting emotionally to something only to, seconds later, realise our reaction was shaped not by what someone said to us, but by the emotional state we happened to be in immediately beforehand. how we are feeling at a given moment doesn’t just infuence our behaviours in negative ways. it is easier to make positive decisions when we are feeling positive about ourselves. so one thing that should  be front of mind for greg the next time he meets  his client, is how to quickly create positive affect at  the start of the meeting. the behavioural scientist’s view emotional reaction to a stimulus can activate behaviours before we even notice them happening our</Page><Page Number="29">30 there are several approaches greg could take to do this, but one of the simplest and most effective is to begin the conversation by enquiring about a feature of his client’s personal life – a hobby or favourite pastime – that he knows provides enjoyment and happiness. this should be done briefy, particularly if the client does not have much time. this approach also highlights the need for an adviser to ensure they take a crucial and sometimes missed step. this is to regularly note down personal details (such as likes and interests) that clients will often volunteer about themselves. these can be just as signifcant as the more formal and usual details (such as their fnancial details). it is especially important for advisers to do this with clients they have known for long periods. this is because new research shows that over time people typically reduce rather than increase their levels of understanding of a client’s likes, dislikes and preferences for one very simple reason. due to the long-standing relationship, they might believe they know their clients better than they actually do and either become less likely to notice small changes in attitudes and preferences, or simply stop asking. another approach would be to use the priming effect from mindspace by moving the meeting to a different venue, to minimise any impact that george’s environment might be having on his mood. perhaps greg could invite his client to his offce for coffee, or meet george at home after work rather than at his offces during working hours. this might only be a small change – but small things are often responsible for making the biggest differences. it is easier to make 	 positive decisions when 	 we are feeling positive 	 about ourselves.</Page><Page Number="30">31 setting the right environmental context for a more productive meeting is crucial for an adviser, but this is just a frst step to help george consider the future life events he struggles to think about. new research considered in the book  the smallbig explores how people  are more likely to consider behaviours that could be benefcial to them in the long term (even if they are costly in the short term) by appealing to their sense of moral responsibility and the future version of themselves. in one experiment, 200 staff who had not been contributing much to their retirement plans were sent a message reminding them of the importance of saving for retirement, and strongly encouraging them to increase the amount of money that they save. in addition to being encouraged to consider their long-term interests, half of the study participants were also told, “start saving more now because your ‘future self’ is entirely dependent on you.” two weeks later when the researchers looked at the action taken, those who received the ‘obligation to future self’ message increased their savings by 0.85% more than those who didn’t. this doesn’t seem that much of a difference, but small additional contributions like this can make big differences in the longer term. this research demonstrates how appealing to people’s moral responsibility to the future version of themselves can be a powerful communication strategy. if greg can show his client the importance of visualising the future and understanding his moral responsibility to himself and his family, george may be more willing to consider future life events, which could even include uncomfortable and unforeseen circumstances. this two-step combination of helping clients fnd a positive frame  of mind and visualising the future can help advisers tackle more challenging conversations. people’s moral responsibility to the future version of themselves can be a powerful communication strategy.</Page><Page Number="31">32 cpd question case study 3 how can the adviser use priming to help the client

is conscious that discussions around certain product areas with her 45 to 60-year-old sandwich generation clients can often  be diffcult, complicated or emotional because of the other family  members involved. conversations with the sandwich generation about serious illness, the possibility of long-term care and the implications of death on a family are ones that can be uncomfortable  for clients and often lead them to avoid – or postpone – important fnancial planning decisions. robyn has worked hard to build strong relationships with her clients over the years. a key part of the success of her business is her relationships. she is often concerned that bringing up diffcult topics like these might impact negatively on the relationships that make her business successful. robyn is aware that these conversations are essential, but she wants to ensure that they are well received.  case study 4 introducing diffcult conversations taking steps to introduce diffcult fnancial conversations such as long-term care and critical illness conversations that touch  on protecting clients and their loved ones  against some of the impacts of illness, sickness, old age or even death are essential, but can be diffcult.</Page><Page Number="33">34 for many years, behavioural scientists have known that a person’s likeability can be a key factor in determining how successful they are at engaging with others. in fact, businesses will often invest signifcant amounts of time and money training staff to develop their people skills and likeability. what may be a surprise though is that, rather than looking for ways to get clients to like you, it’s much more effective to look for genuinely likeable things about your clients. there is a seldom considered  reason for this. there is no actual motive to engage with, listen to  and follow the advice of someone just because you like them. but there are many reasons why you would want to engage with, listen to and follow the advice of someone who likes you. people who like us, generally  have our best interests at heart.  they are more likely to give us the information and advice that will best suit our situation and needs – even if that information and advice might be uncomfortable to discuss. the messenger effect of mindspace shows that we are much less likely to shoot the messenger if we see them as trustworthy, an expert and someone who likes us. case study 4 introducing diffcult conversations the behavioural scientist’s view people who like us, generally have our best  interests at heart messages that come from those that we see as expert, trustworthy and that we know like us are typically the 	 most effective.</Page><Page Number="34">35 this insight should be comforting for robyn to hear, for two reasons. firstly, as she has such strong and productive relationships, she has already done much of the hard work. her clients like her and it is very likely that she likes her clients. as a result, a favourable context has already been created for these potentially diffcult conversations. the second reason is that the more robyn’s clients see that she likes them, the more likely they will be to listen to and consider her advice when potentially diffcult topics are raised. at the very least, they will be much more likely to listen to her than to an adviser who doesn’t have the beneft of such strong relationships. while this will be comforting to advisers concerned about protecting the relationships that they have developed over many years, it can still be diffcult taking the frst step to discussing such sensitive topics, especially if it involves the client talking to other family members. but there is one helpful strategy an adviser can use that would potentially help their clients raise a diffcult issue with a loved one. the late american psychologist and author virginia satir would, when broaching diffcult topics, advocate talking in ‘quotes’. this approach involves introducing a potentially emotionally charged subject through the eyes of someone else. or, put another way, share a situation that someone else faced, in the hope that the client will ‘read between the lines’ and consider how it might be applied to their own situation. it is likely that many advisers already adopt such a strategy, by sharing case studies and accounts of other clients in similar situations. doing so can be extremely effective. it is also a strategy that is entirely in keeping with the theme of a small change that could make a big difference. it can be diffcult 	 	    taking that frst step towards delicate topics</Page><Page Number="35">36 there is a second approach that robyn might also consider – one that at frst glance appears surprising, but can be effective. the idea is for the adviser to suggest to their client that they swap roles for some of the meeting. the adviser becomes the client and vice versa. doing so could give the client permission to ask questions related to the concerns they are having and could be the catalyst for opening up a diffcult conversation. this could be simply accomplished by the adviser saying something like, “if i were in your position some of the questions i would be considering would be…” before going on to list one or two questions you want that client to consider. then afterwards check that those are in fact relevant considerations for the client and enquire if there is anything else they’d like to discuss. it is understandable that some advisers might experience concern about the impact of introducing diffcult conversations like these with their clients, but the evidence is that when done sympathetically and in the context of an already well-established relationship, the outcome should be positive for both the client and adviser. the suggestion is for the adviser and their client to swap roles with each other for some of the interaction.</Page><Page Number="36">37 cpd question case study 4 what is one
